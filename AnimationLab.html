        During the first unit of Introduction to Programming Class, we learned
        about animation. We were then assigned a mini project called the
        Animation Lab in which we were supposed to make a sketch that
        incorperated animation. I first made on of those loading screens that
        had a logo bounce around. Then during one of our classes, I put a sketch
        of a watermelon I had made the previous week instead of the basic ball.
        I wanted to make it spin so I spent a long time making the watermelon
        both bounce around the screen and spin. I ended up having to use alot of
        math involving radians but I think that the finished product was worth
        it. The effect of the spinning wattermellon creates spirals that go
        across the page! This is one of my favority sketchs and it always
        statisfies me when the whole screen gets filled up!
