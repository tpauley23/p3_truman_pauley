      This was the first big project that we made in my Introduction to
      Programming class. The prompt for the project was: create an album cover
      for an album/song that represents your feeling and emotions while
      listening to the song. I chose to make an cover for the song "Mr. Blue
      Sky" by Electric Light Orchestra. I didn't hear this song until I watch
      <a class="textLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnuc2GoY0so">
        Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.</a

      I really like this song because it is peaceful and everytime I listen to
      this song I feel Happy. I chose to make the cover for the song a blue sky
      (like it says in the song) with rolling clouds and a bright midday sun.
      This song just makes me think of a bright sunny summer day so I chose to
      make the cover just that. The most difficult stuggle I went through while
      making this sketch was the clouds. I wanted the clouds to be different
      every time they passed by so I created one singular function that randomly
      created the shape and size of the clouds. This was the most difficult for
      me because it was the first time I created such a randimized function. I
      hope you enjoyed the sketch!
