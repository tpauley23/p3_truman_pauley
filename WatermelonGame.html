        For this sketch I added different elements copied from previous sketches that I made on <a class="https://p5js.org/#:~:text=Hello!-,p5.,should%20be%20accessible%20to%20everyone.">p5.js</a> I made a watermelon that
        bounced around the screen and I also used an assortment of rectanges and
        ellipses to make a recreation of character from the popular game
        <a class="textLink" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/among-us/id1351168404">
          Amoung Us.</a> In this sketch you can control the characture by using the
          classic MineCraft controles of "W," "A," "S," and "D" Keys to move the
          Character. The watermelon will bounce around the screen at different
          speeds and you have to use your skills of "Dodge, Duck, Dip, Dive,
          Dodge"
          <a class = "textLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peUyLXrgYZ0">(...)</a> to avoid
          the watermelon!
        </a> If You get hit by the watermelon it GAME OVER! The longer you stay alive the higher your score gets! You can see your score in the top left corner! The longer you stay alive the Faster the water melon goes! Have Fun Playing! The highest score that I ever got was a 38!
        Also, You can go off the screen just know that you won't be getting any points while your off the screen. Have Fun!
